The fact is that move assignment operators assign memory portions from the main object that we've pass to that operator, hence after operation it'll deallocate memory so we cannot use that object again, however for copy operators you can use that object after operation. Additionally, copy constructor takes lvalue which points to some data block in memory, but move constructor gets rvalue, so it makes It much faster.
